# Have you heard of scala

Hi guys! This is my second post of fun and exciting computer science blog. Today I will talk about the fabulous functional programming language scala. Have you guys heard about it before? Actually it was my first time using functional language, so I had to suffer a little. But eventually I think it is very efficient and good looking language. 

So what is functional programming? In wikipedia, it says - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. Functional programs are based on mathematical and implemented computational models, therefore there are lots of efficiency when the user is calling the exisitng function. On the other hand, it is harder to use for the user who are used to objective language such as java or c++. Ironically, scala is based on java. There are several other types of functional programming languages as well such as ocaml, 

One thing that I really enjoyed about this project is that this project actually resembles machine learning technique. When I see those phenomenal machine learning methods, I've always wondered what would be the sufficient input and how do they calculate the result based on limited number of data. It was good opporutnity for me to think about the actual implementation of machine learning algorithm. For this project, it takes dining histories and restaurants' information in the mall. It would be way simpler if we know which paramaters we can take in real world. 


The most thing I like about functional language is usage of recursive. Recursive functions has been my favorite way to iterate the functions every since 1114. I like the way it calcualtes that startaing one method techincally don't end until
