# Have you heard of scala

Hi guys! This is my second post of fun and exciting computer science blog. Today I will talk about the fabulous functional programming language scala. Have you guys heard about it before? Actually it was my first time using functional language, so I had to suffer a little. But eventually I think it is very efficient and good looking language. 

So what is functional programming? In wikipedia, it says - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. Functional programs are based on mathematical and implemented computational models, therefore there are lots of efficiency when the user is calling the exisitng function. On the other hand, it is harder to use for the user who are used to objective language such as java or c++. Ironically, scala is based on java.

The most thing I like about functional language is usage of recursive. Recursive functions has been my favorite way to iterate the functions every since 1114. I like the way it calcualtes that startaing one method techincally don't end until
