# Comparative Language Project 1 – Technical Blog

If you are interested/working in computer science filed, have you ever wondered about magical compiler that understand the code in every language? After consequently learning Java, Object C, C, C++, JavaScript, and python based on the course schedule, little syntaxes such as “;”  or “range” got all mixed up in my head.  Learning new programming languages definitely gives you the great advantages especially in job market, but prompting yourself about syntaxes of languages you already knew is as much as important as learning a new one. I think it is great opportunity for computer science majors to take class like comparative language that we can understand the functions and logics behind those amazing languages along with providing informations about how to select the most efficient languages for each tasks. 

The project is basically two parts, one for converting Roman numerals in swift and the other one is parser for SQL database command. I had heard about swift that it is the language for iOS application, but I personally never used it before. From Wikipedia, Swift is a general purpose programming language designed to work with Apple’s Cocoa nad Cocoa Touchframeworks based on existing Objective C written for Apple product. According to Indeed.com in 2016, iOS/Swift is 9th largest number of programming jobs after SQL, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, C#, Python, C++ and Php. I was surprised about the fact that Java is actually the second most demanding programing language not the first. 

Let’s go back to the problem, the Roman numeral translation was a good experience for me to learn about swift. There were few syntaxes in Swift that I had to constantly reminding myself, but the most confusing part was usage of the semicolon. I was reading through the Swift documents, and it was very interesting to see how different code grammer varies on each versions. When I was updating the version of Java, I did not even reconginze the huge difference in basic functionality. However, in Siwft, the changes are significant. Another fact that interested me during this project is the usage of emoji. I love emojis but this was actually my first time printing out emojis on my terminal. It was
